# hello_world
Hello world.  Lets get to making. 
My nae is Nick.  I am a 26 year old working in tech support and I am looking to get started in the web-dev/software development world.  
My interests are range wildly from music; to animals husbandry and biology; to alternative energy, battery design and renewables.  
For my first big project in software dev I would like to help my girlfriend out by making a system that can track her hedgehog pedegries more efficiantly.
